# <a name="introduction"> BlogBuzz </a>

üöÄ I'm thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project: BlogBuzz! üìù


I built this full-stack blog app using some amazing technologies and learned so much along the way. Here's the tech stack:

Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Redux
Backend: Spring Boot (my first time!), Java, Redis, MongoDB, Docker

Key Learnings:
Spring Boot: My first time using it‚Äîwent from basics to advanced features!
Integration: Smoothly combined frontend and backend technologies.
Performance: Boosted with Redis caching.
Deployment: Containerized with Docker for consistent environments.
This project has been an incredible learning journey, and I‚Äôm really proud of how it turned out! Check out BlogBuzz and let me know what you think! üåü
